## Review

####Overview: 
Bean, A., Groth-Marnat, G. (2016). Video Gamers and Personality: A Five-Factor Model to Understand Game Playing Style. Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 5(1),27-38.

This paper uses the Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality measurements to categorize World of Warcraft (WoW) players based on server playing style and character specialization. 

The hypotheses analyzed were:
* WoW players will choose their main character based in part on the personality traints of the player.
* Players will exhibit different personality attributes between the variety of character classes, races, and specializations.
* Server playing styles are affected by different personality characteristics.

Over 1200 players participated in the study, which found that female players scored higher than male players in agreeableness, neuroticism, and openness. Statistically significant personality dimensions for extraversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, and agreeablness were also found depending on server playing styles.

####Expanded Review: 

 Bean and Groth-Marnat (2016) explored the relationship between video game players (gamers) personality traits and the choices that they make when developing virtual characters in the current most popular Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game: World of Warcraft. The authors provided as motivation for their experiment the lack of research on the potential impact of personality factors on gaming despite the fact that the activity continues to rise in popularity as a recreational activity. Additionally, they pointed to the popular assertion that exposure to violent videogames may be associated with violence in chilren and adolescents with particular focus on the question of whether video gamers tend to exhibit different personality traits from the rest of the population. The experiment presented by Bean and Groth-Marnat (2016) aimed to explore specifically the relationship between the factors of the Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality measure and the following aspects of character development in WoW: character race, class, specialization, and faction (see https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/ for details of available choices). Additionally, they explored the relationship between personality and player's biological sex as well as preferred play style (player-versus-player, player-versus-environment, role-playing). Although other more sensitive personality measures may exist, Bean and Groth-Marnat (2016) note that the high reliability and convergent validity of the BFI as well as its ability to be administered online made it an appropriate choice for their collection methods. 
 
  Results of statistical analyses run on personality and survey data collected from 1,210 participants showed that the BFI only meaningfully provided predictive power regarding gamers' play style, and not race, class, specialization, or faction. Interestingly, Extraversion was found to be highest for participants who preferred player-versus-player interaction as opposed to role-playing which relies heavily on player-player social interaction. Similarly, Neuroticism was found to be highest for participants who preferred role-playing which may point to some desire of those individuals to exert control over the way that they are perceived in the virtual world of WoW. Bean and Groth-Marnat (2016) also present tangential findings confirming the tendency for females to exhibit higher Agreeableness, Neuroticism, and Openness. Perhaps one of the more interesting results of the experiment was that WoW players were not found to differ significantly from a non-player population along any of the BFI factors; that is important in the context of the question of video games and violence because it would seem that if there is any credibility to the claim, it must be driven by the games themselves and not the sorts of individuals who play them. 
  
  The findings of Bean and Gorth-Marnat (2016) suggest that a BFI model may not be appropriate for predicting a wide spectrum of outcomes, such as choice of character class (14 options), but can serve to illustrate differences on more clearly defined scales as indicated by the findings related to play-style (3 options). The lack of findings regarding faction (2 options) may seem to disagree with that claim; however, faction choices determine nuanced aspects of gameplay in WoW which are less likely to be impacted by personality than the other factors investigated. Future research should more concretely establish why personality factors may be expected to predict payer's choices regarding their character development, and hone in on more concrete spectrums within the factors that may be relevant. Race, for example, may have not been predicted by the BFI model because of the number and variety available whereas a further classification such as "human-like race" (such as elves, gnomes, or dwarves) or "monster race" (such as orc, worgen, or tauren) may be predictable given player's personalities. 



####Clarity of Exposition: 
  The exposition of Bean and Groth-Marnat (2016) is written quite clearly, but seems to provide motivations for the conducted research that do not align with the methods or the vast majority of the discussion. Notably, the authors spend a decent portion of their introduction pointing to the question of whether video game exposure may be causally related to violence, but do not seem to make any foray into measuring violent tendencies or to discuss the issue beyond noting that WoW players seem to have similar personality sets as a whole compared to a comparable non-player population. Additionally, although the authors are likely correct that little research has been done to study personality factors relating to WoW, the general literature relating to personality regarding video games is not small and should perhaps have been more the focus of the exposition than the seemingly tangential question of video game violence. Overall, it seemed as though the authors used the “hot-button issue” of Violence & Video Games to catch reader’s attention, but then took their research in a different direction. 

####Quality of References: 
  The majority of strong claims made in this article are well supported by relevant research.
Reproducibility: The primary reason for the vast number of one-off personality based studies is the immense ease of their execution, and similar to many of its counterparts this study could be easily replicated given enough commitment to disseminating the experimental materials. On the other hand, whether the results could necessarily be reproduced may depend on the population to which researchers have access: online forums tend to be self-selecting communities, and any in game solicitation would occur mostly through the network of the researchers involved so it is possible that it might be difficult to collect a similar population and reproduce the results.

Rating: 3

####Explanation of Rating: 
The fundamental research questions and methods presented by Bean and Groth-Marnat provide interesting insight into one of the fastest growing recreational activities in the first-world: video-gaming. They fell short in some places with respect to motivating the research and making only those conclusions that were strongly supported by their data. The mark for a 4 rating was missed slightly because of the addition of tangential arguments which took up space and reading time, but added little-to-nothing to the actual investigation.
